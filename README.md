# Hello!
## üëãüèª I'm Chris
I‚Äôm a software engineer, architect and technical lead.

I believe

* in Ethical, inclusive, appropriate and sensible application of big data and AI.
* in robust, yet pragmatic automated testing (100% test coverage is worthless if it doesn‚Äôt do what it was designed to do!).
* in designing systems that minimise carbon emissions and energy usage during their operational life.
* in being accountable for the products you build.
* in empowering users to achieve their goals, rather than mollycoddling them.
* that engineers should own the "how", and help shape the "why".
* that legacy code != bad code. Bad code was always bad. All code becomes legacy code eventually.
* that tech debt should be managed carefully - not avoided at all costs, but not incurred without thought either.

My super powers include systems interface design and domain modelling, particularly for esoteric legacy systems.
