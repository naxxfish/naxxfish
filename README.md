# Hello!
## üëãüèª I'm Chris
I‚Äôm a software engineer, architect and product manager.

I believe in:

* Ethical, appropriate and sensible application of big data and AI.
* Robust, yet pragmatic automated testing (100% test coverage is worthless if it doesn‚Äôt do what it was designed to do!).
* Designing systems that minimise carbon and energy usage during their operational life.
* Being accountable for the products you build.
* Empowering users to achieve their goals, rather than mollycoddling them.

My super powers include systems interface design and domain modelling, particularly for esoteric legacy systems.
